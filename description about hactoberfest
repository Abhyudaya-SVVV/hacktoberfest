Hacktoberfest is an annual event organized by DigitalOcean, GitHub, and other partners to encourage open-source contributions. Held every October, it invites developers of all skill levels to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Participants can earn rewards,
such as limited-edition t-shirts and stickers, by making a certain number of pull requests during the month. Hacktoberfest not only fosters collaboration and
  community engagement but also helps maintain and improve open-source projects worldwide.
It's a great opportunity for developers to learn, contribute, and connect with the broader tech community.
